# Let's get started..

My name is Othniel.. many of the people I met used to say I am fun and
clever.. I do believe the first one and.. I am not sure about the second!

I love doing things by myself and I don't like to be (or even feel) pressured
at all. 

I am in one the best university in the world.. I love to say I am a NU student (lol)

and I proudly belong to the QuaRCS-labs.. a place I have been the most challenged in 
these last six months.. well hold on today is sys.Date()

Welcome in this adventure.. We sure gonna have fun learning and using Github!
